# üèó Release management playground

This repository is a playground with multiple branches, PRs and tags to test out the release flow. You can play around by creating PRs to staging and publishing release drafts.

## üåä Release flow

### Adding changes

1. Create a new branch from staging.
1. Make changes.
1. Push your branch and create a PR into staging.
1. If your PR _only_ updates a dependency, add the `dependency` label. These will be added to a separate section in the release notes.
1. If your PR fixes a bug, add the `bug` label. These will be added to a separate section in the release notes.
1. Merge your branch into staging. A [GitHub action](.github/workflow/release-drafter.yml) will kick off. Note that this may take a few minutes! ‚è∞
1. Rinse and repeat as you like.

See how the release draft keeps udating in https://github.com/reisbalans/nextrelease-test/releases. Don't see the change you expect yet? Check if the action is still running or has an error at https://github.com/reisbalans/nextrelease-test/actions.

### Releasing a new version

1. Create a new branch from staging.
1. Run `yarn bump:minor` in the project root. (or `yarn bump:patch`, `yarn bump:major` for other semver updates).
1. Commit, push and merge the changes.
1. Go to https://github.com/reisbalans/nextrelease-test/releases.
1. Check that the draft release looks in order. The version numbers should match your bump changes. Note that the action may take a few minutes! ‚è∞
1. Click 'Edit', then 'Publish release' without making any changes. A [GitHub action](.github/workflow/release-master-pr.yml) will kick off. Note that this may take a few minutes! ‚è∞
1. When the action has finished, check the PR to master that was created.
1. The PR body was created with a template, you can update it as required. For example, add a refreshing new gif! ü§©

Note that it is assumed a release is always merged into master. Should a release PR be closed without merging, the next one will not include all changes but just those from the latest release. (For example when a patch is requested on reviewing the release PR). In this case you should manually add a link to the other included release(s) in the PR body.

## üéã Branches

### master

This branch is the production environment and should always be deployable.

### staging

This branch is the working branch. New commits can only be added via PRs. On arbitrary intervals a release is branched from staging.

### master-release-vX.Y.Z

A branch with this naming pattern is automatically generated when a release draft is published. It is branched from that release tag and set to be merged into master.
